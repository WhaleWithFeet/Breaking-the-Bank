            <p>Absolutely not. Little security is actually present on our site, so your data and money is about as safe as a chicken in a hurricane. The whole "vault" thing is just something we thought would sound safe.</p>

            <p>Debit card? Bold of you to assume we'd even give you one, so have fun with that. What are we, a company that gives free handouts or something? Get real.</p>
